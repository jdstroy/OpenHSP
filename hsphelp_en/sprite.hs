%inst
Initializes the standard sprite system.
If the parameters are omitted, sprites are initialized with a maximum of 512 sprites, 1024 character definitions, a circumference precision of 64, and 16 map definitions.
The es_ini command can be executed any number of times, so it can also be used when you want to clear all sprites.
^
p3 specifies how many degrees the angle used in commands such as es_adir will be for one revolution. The
Values that can be specified are 64, multiples of 256, and multiples of 360. If other values are
If specified, the closest value that meets the condition below the specified value is set.

p1,p2
p1(0)=Drawing resolution in the X direction
p2(0)=Drawing resolution in the Y direction
%inst
Resets the drawing resolution of sprites.
The size specified by the p1,p2 parameters is set as the screen drawing resolution.
If you specify 0 or a negative value for the p1,p2 parameters, the size of the current drawing destination screen is used.
Normally, the screen resolution is automatically set when initialized with the es_ini command, so there is no need to reset the resolution.
The es_screen command should be used to change the settings when drawing to a different buffer with a different resolution.
^
When the sprite drawing resolution is reset with the es_screen command, the sprite valid area is automatically reset as well.

%inst
Sets the sprite valid area (border).
Sprites whose screen coordinates are not within the range of (p1, p2)-(p3, p4) are automatically deleted. (Sprites with the ESSPFLAG_NOWIPE flag specified are not deleted)

p3(100)=Hit check area (%)
p4($3ff)=p4=Specification of special effect (EP value)

%inst
Specifies the size when defining a character pattern for a sprite.
(p1, p2) is the X, Y size of the character.
^
p3 specifies what percentage of the hit check area is used for collision detection. If you specify 100, hit checking is performed to the full size specified by (p1, p2). (The es_sizeex command is also available for setting a more detailed collision detection area.)
If you specify 0, the character will not have collision detection.
p4 is the default setting for special effects (EP value). Normally, you can omit this.
The special effects (EP value) parameter specifies settings such as semi-transparency and additive synthesis. See the Standard Sprite Programming Guide for details.
^
There are no particular restrictions on the X and Y sizes of the characters, but specifying a character pattern that protrudes from the off-screen buffer is invalid.
The settings of the es_size command remain valid for subsequent character definitions.

p5=Window buffer ID
%inst
Defines the character pattern of the sprite.
^
The character of the size set by es_size is registered from the coordinates (p2, p3) to the character No. specified by p1.
The target images must be loaded into the window buffer in advance with the picload command or celload command.
If the window buffer ID is specified by p5, a part of the image is cut out from that window buffer, and if p5 is omitted, from the window buffer that is currently being operated on, and registered as a character pattern.
^
If you omit the p1 parameter or set it to a negative value, an available character No. is automatically assigned. After executing this command, the character No. assigned is stored in the system variable stat, so you can know which No. was used by that.
^
One es_pat command registers a character pattern to the specified character No. If you need many character patterns, you need to register that many patterns.
The es_patanim command is also available for registering character patterns in batches.
^
The p4 parameter is a setting for character animation.
If it is 0, there is no animation. If it is 1 or more, the character is displayed for the specified number of frames, and then the next character (character No.+1) is displayed.

All information is stored as 32-bit integers. Most parameters have separate commands for setting them, so there is no need to use the `es_setp` command.
Also, sprite coordinates, acceleration, and scaling factors are fixed-point numbers, so they differ from the actual values. In that case, please use the `es_pos` command, etc.
You can specify change options with the p4 parameter. Option values behave as follows. It can be used for bitwise set/reset.

Searches for the sprite No. that has the specified type value among the registered sprites.
You can specify multiple types simultaneously for the type value of p2.
For example, to target type1 and type4, specify 5 as 1+4.
^
If you omit the specification of p2 or specify 0, all sprites with all type values will be targeted for the search.
^
The search proceeds sequentially from the sprite No. specified by p3 to the No. specified by p4.
If this is omitted, all sprites from No. 0 will be searched.
When a matching sprite is found, the result is assigned to p1 and the process ends.
^
If no matching sprite is found as a result of the search, -1 is assigned.

Performs sprite collision (hit) detection.
^
Searches for a sprite that is colliding with (overlapping) the sprite No. specified by p2,
and assigns the result to the variable specified by p1.
^
You can specify the type value to be targeted for collision detection with p3.
If p3 is omitted or 0, collision with all sprites is determined.
You can specify multiple types simultaneously for the type value of p3.
For example, to target type1 and type4, specify 5 as 1+4.
^
The hit check area (%) specified when registering the character pattern is used for collision detection.
Even if the images actually overlap, they are not considered to collide unless the hit check area ranges overlap.
The p4 parameter is prepared for future expansion and is not currently implemented. The display magnification of the sprite is reflected in the collision range, but please note that even when rotated, the rectangular collision range does not change.
The p5 and p6 parameters allow you to specify the range of sprite Nos. to search for collisions. Specify the sprite No. to start with p5 and the sprite No. to end with p6 (the No. specified by p6 is also included in the search). If you specify a negative value for p6, the end No. is set. If you omit the parameters, all sprites will be targeted for detection.
^
The result is assigned to the variable specified by p1. If there are no colliding sprites, -1 is assigned. If there are colliding sprites, the sprite No. of the smallest one is assigned. If there are multiple colliding sprites, the one with the smaller sprite No. is prioritized.

The coordinate values set by the es_pos command are internally 16-bit fixed-point numbers. Normally, the values are automatically converted, but the conversion is disabled by adding ESSPSET_DIRECT to the setting option.
Also, by adding ESSPSET_MASKBIT, the previous decimal part will be retained when converting to a 16-bit fixed-point number.

The es_pos command is used to change only the coordinates of an already set sprite. To set a new sprite, use the es_set command.

After execution, a value is returned to the system variable stat. A value of 0 or greater is returned if the command completes successfully; a negative value is returned if an error occurs for any reason.

Changes the rotation angle and display magnification of the sprite specified by p1.
The sprite is rotated to the angle specified by p2. The value of p2 is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and the larger the value, the more it rotates clockwise. The value for one full rotation is specified by the es_ini command.

The display magnification in the X and Y directions is changed by the (p3, p4) parameters.
If the value of p3 or p4 is omitted or is a negative value, the previous magnification is retained without being changed.
The display magnification is converted with 100% as 1x. If you specify 250, it will be 2.5x.
Immediately after setting a sprite with the es_set command, the angle is 0 and the magnification is 100%.

Specify the movement speed in % with p4. If p4 is omitted or 100 is specified,
the speed will be 100%, and the sprite will continue to move by the increment specified by (p2, p3) per frame.
If the movement speed is set to 50 (%) and the increment is specified as (+4, -2), the actual increment will be (+2, -1).
The unit of increment is accurately moved even if it is less than 1 dot. For example, even if you move (1, 0) at 10% in one frame, it will be calculated to move 1 dot after 10 frames.

After execution, a value is returned to the system variable stat. A value of 0 or greater is returned if the command completes successfully; a negative value is returned if an error occurs for any reason.

Sets the display callback of the sprite specified by p1.
Specify the label of the subroutine with p2. After that, the subroutine will be called in the same way as the gosub command each time the sprite is displayed.

When the subroutine is actually called, the sprite No. is assigned to the system variable iparam,
the type value to wparam, and the character No. to lparam.

Specify the sprite No. with p1, and specify the direction with p2. The direction is specified up to the number specified by es_ini. 0 is directly below, and it increases counterclockwise.

Specify the movement speed in % with p3. If p3 is omitted or 100 (%) is specified,
it will move a distance of 1 dot per frame in the specified direction.

After execution, a value is returned to the system variable stat. A value of 0 or greater is returned if the command completes successfully; a negative value is returned if an error occurs for any reason.

%inst
The es_aim command, like the es_adir command, is for moving a sprite in the specified direction. In the es_aim command, the target X, Y coordinates to move to are specified instead of the direction. The sprite calculates the direction from the current coordinates to the target coordinates and starts moving.

This command is useful, for example, when you want a missile fired from an enemy to move towards the player.

Specify the movement speed in % with p4. If p3 is omitted or 100 (%) is specified,
it will move a distance of 1 dot per frame in the specified direction.

When this command is executed, the movement direction is returned to the system variable stat.
This can be used to create a 3-way bullet that aims at the player.

%inst
Draws the registered sprites on the screen.
Normally, if you omit the p1 and p2 parameters, you can draw all sprites. Be sure to draw between redraw 0 and redraw 1.

If you want to draw only a part of the registered sprites, specify the starting sprite No. in p1 and the number of sprites to draw in p2.
If the specification of p1 and p2 is omitted, all sprites will be drawn.

You can hold internal processing using the p3 parameter.

| Value | Macro Name | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | ESDRAW_NORMAL | Execute all processing |
| 1 | ESDRAW_NOMOVE | Hold movement processing |
| 2 | ESDRAW_NOANIM | Hold animation processing |
| 4 | ESDRAW_NOCALLBACK | Hold callback routine |
| 8 | ESDRAW_NODISP | Hold display |
| 16 | ESDRAW_NOSORT | Hold sorting |

Normally, when a command is executed, sprite movement → animation processing → display processing → callback processing are executed, but each process can be held.
ESDRAW_NO* macros can be added to specify them at the same time.
This allows you to temporarily stop movement and animation. Normally, there is no problem omitting the p3 parameter.

If you specify the p4 and p5 parameters, the priority specified by the es_set command or the es_setpri command is referenced, and the sprites are sorted and drawn in the order of the values. At that time, it is possible to draw only the range from p3 to p4.
If the p4 and p5 parameters are specified, the sprites are sorted according to their priority, and the sprites with higher priority values are displayed in the foreground. (However, if ESDRAW_NOSORT is specified in the processing hold flag, the sort is disabled)
If the p4 and p5 parameters are negative or omitted, the priority values are ignored, and the smaller the sprite No., the more foreground it is displayed.
Here's the translation of the provided text into English, focusing on clarity and accuracy within the context of the HSP3 programming language:

  EP Value     Content
-----------------------------------------------------------
  0~255   Alpha channel value (0=Transparent, 255=Opaque)

  +$500    Performs additive blending on the original image (equivalent to gmode5)
  +$600    Performs subtractive blending on the original image (equivalent to gmode6)
^p
This value is a combination of the alpha channel value and the blending parameters from the gmode command.
The default value is $3ff (alpha channel=255, equivalent to gmode3).

^p
Specifies the timer duration (number of frames) in p3. The blinking or fading operation will end after this number of frames has elapsed.

ESSPF_FADEOUT/ESSPF_FADEIN perform the fade over the entire specified timer period, while ESSPF_EFADE and ESSPF_EFADEWIPE2 fade at a constant rate regardless of the timer period.

Setting p3 to -1 will make the count infinite.

Please note that fade-in and fade-out will take into account the alpha channel value (transparency) set for the sprite at the time of setting.

In the case of fade-out, the alpha channel value changes from the set value to completely transparent. In the case of fade-in, the change is from completely transparent to the set alpha channel value.

If you select a mode that does not disappear after fading out, be aware that a valid sprite will remain displayed even though it is not visible.

p5(0)=Display frame number (0)
p6=Window buffer ID
%inst
Defines the character patterns of sprites in batches.
^
Character patterns are registered starting from the character No. specified by p1 for the number specified by p2. Use the es_pat command to define a single character No.
The character patterns to be registered are consecutive horizontal areas in the image. Characters are registered assuming that patterns are arranged to the right from the coordinates (p3, p4) with the size set by es_size.
The target image here must be read into the window buffer in advance using the picload command or the celload command.
If the character No. is a negative value, an empty No. is automatically secured and used. In that case, the character No. is assigned to the system variable `stat`.
Extracts a portion of an image and registers it as a character pattern. If a window buffer ID is specified in p5, the image is extracted from that window buffer. If p5 is omitted, the image is extracted from the window buffer that is currently being operated on.

If the p1 parameter is omitted or set to a negative value, an available character number is automatically assigned. After executing this command, the assigned character number is stored in the system variable stat, allowing you to determine which number was used.

The p5 parameter is used to configure character animation. If set to 0, there is no animation. If set to 1 or higher, the character is displayed for the specified number of frames, and then the next character (character number + 1) is displayed.

Normally, an animation is defined where the number of patterns specified in the p2 parameter is repeated with the wait frame of p5. If ESSPPAT_1SHOT($1000) is added to the p2 parameter, a pattern is defined that disappears after animating multiple patterns.

^
Retrieves the X and Y information, such as sprite coordinates, and assigns it to two variables.

Specify the sprite number in p1, and set the variables to be assigned in the p2 and p3 parameters.

You can specify what kind of coordinates to acquire with the setting options of p4.

^p
The coordinate values acquired by the es_getpos command are internally 16-bit fixed-point numbers. Usually, they are automatically converted, but conversion is disabled by adding ESSPSET_DIRECT to the setting options.

After execution, a value is returned to the system variable stat. If the command completes successfully, a value of 0 or greater is returned. If an error occurs for some reason, a negative value is returned.
^
Initializes the background map.
^
Initializes a BG map with an arbitrary size.

Specify the BG number to initialize in p1. BG numbers can be specified from 0 to 15.

Specify the variable to store the map data in p2. This variable must be initialized in advance as an array variable with "map overall X size x map overall Y size" elements using the dim command.

Specify the overall X and Y sizes of the map in (p3, p4).

Specify the X and Y sizes of the part of the map to display in (p5, p6).

Parameters p3 to p6 are all in map cell units. For example, if the overall size is 4x4, specify a variable initialized with "dim map, 4*4".

This variable directly holds the content of the map data, and if the value is 0, the map cell number is 0, storing the cell number as is. (The cell number is the same as the split image number specified by the celput command.)

Specify the screen buffer ID in p7 where the map part (cell) images are loaded. Images must be loaded into this buffer in advance using the picload or celload command. (Set the cell size for the map cell image using the celdiv command.)

Configure the behavior of the BG map with the setting options in p8.

Displays the background map.
^
Displays the BG map of the specified BG number.

It is necessary to initialize the BG map size, cell information, etc., in advance with the es_bgmap command.

Specify the display start position (top left) on the screen with the (p2, p3) parameters.

Specify the map display start position (top left) in dot units with the (p4, p5) parameters.

Normally, the map is displayed from the (0, 0) position within the entire map.

By specifying the map display start position, you can change the position of the map that is at the top left when displaying a part of the entire map.

The map display start position (p4, p5) can be used when scrolling a large map.

After command execution, the number of event attributes included in the displayed map parts (cells) is returned to the system variable stat.

Event attribute information can be acquired with the es_getbghit command.

The acquired event attribute information will only be ESMAPHIT_NOTICE and ESMAPHIT_EVENT.
^
If an attribute group value (ESMAP_PRM_GROUP) is set by the es_bgparam command, only cell numbers with the specified group are displayed.

Also, if an animation flag is set in the attribute value, a value with the animation index value (ESMAP_PRM_ANIM) added to the cell number is displayed.
^
If map display fails for some reason, a negative value is returned to the system variable stat.
^
Writes a string to the BG map.
^
Writes the code of the string specified by "str" to the BG map of the specified BG number.

It is necessary to initialize the BG map size, cell information, etc., in advance with the es_bgmap command.

The es_bgmes command operates on the premise that the BG map is in a state where it can display character fonts in ASCII code order.

Writes the character codes included in the string to the right, starting from the map position specified by (p2, p3).
^
Specify the offset value for the character code in the p4 parameter. Normally, it can be 0 or omitted. For example, the character "A" has a character code of 65, and the value 65 is written to the map.

If a line feed code is included, it moves to the next line.
^
If map writing fails for some reason, a negative value is returned to the system variable stat.
^
Sets the parent sprite.
^
Sets the sprite or BG map that is the parent of the specified sprite.

By setting the parent sprite number in the p2 parameter, the sprite will be displayed at a relative coordinate from the parent's coordinate.

If you specify a negative value for p2, the parent sprite setting will be canceled and the sprite will return to normal sprite display.
^
Normally, specify 0 for the setting option in the p3 parameter.

By specifying 1 for the p3 parameter, the sprite is set to display with the BG map as the parent. In that case, you can specify the BG number in the p2 parameter.

By the es_bglink command, you can automatically set the BG map as the parent when setting a new sprite.

If a sprite with a parent sprite further has a parent, the coordinates are recursively searched.
^
After command execution, a negative value is returned to the system variable stat if setting fails for some reason.
^
Changes sprite information collectively.
^
Collectively changes the coordinates of sprites with numbers from p1 to p2.

If the specifications of p1 and p2 are omitted, all sprites will be targeted.
^
You can specify the type value with p3. If 4 is specified for p3, sprites with a type value of 4 are targeted.

If the p3 parameter is omitted or 0 is specified, all type values will be targeted.
^
You can specify the values to add to the sprite coordinate parameters X and Y in the (p4, p5) parameters, respectively. If you specify a negative value, it will be subtracted.

The values specified here will be added (subtracted) to all sprites that are the target of the change.

p1(0)=Sprite No. to perform the determination
%inst
Executes collision detection with a sprite based on the attribute value set in the BG map.
It is necessary to set an appropriate attribute value in the map data in advance using the es_bgattr command.
The es_bghit command determines whether a sprite comes into contact with a character on the BG map when the sprite is moved, and creates a list of results. If you want to perform collision detection based on arbitrary coordinates, use the es_bghitpos command.
Specify the sprite No. with the p1 parameter. The sprite must have collision detection with the BG enabled in advance.
When moving a sprite, it is necessary to set the amount of movement in advance using the es_adir, es_apos commands, etc.
Even if the amount of movement is 0, the direction of movement is automatically set if there are settings such as gravity.

The collision detection result between the BG map and the sprite is created in the same way as the es_bghitpos command. This result can be obtained with the es_getbghit command.
In addition, the outline of the result is stored in the sprite parameter "ESI_MOVERES" that can be obtained with the es_get command. Bits 0 to 7 (0 to 255) of this value store the map attribute Opt value (bits 8 to 15) of the area overlapping with itself.
This value also has the following flags.

^p
The movement processing of the sprite moved by the es_bghit command is canceled in the es_draw and es_move commands.
If multiple characters are hit simultaneously, multiple results are created. In that case, specify the index value of the result and acquire it with the es_getbghit command.

%inst
Executes collision detection from the specified coordinates based on the attribute value set in the BG map.
It is necessary to set an appropriate attribute value in the map data in advance using the es_bgattr command.
The es_bghitpos command determines whether a rectangular area comes into contact with a character on the BG map when the rectangular area is moved, and creates a list of results. If you want to perform collision detection based on sprite coordinates, use the es_bghit command.
The result can be obtained with the es_getbghit command.
Specify the BG No. with p1. BG No. can be specified from 0 to 15.
Specify the upper left coordinates of the rectangle with the (p2, p3) parameters. This specifies the coordinates on the BG map in dots.
Specify the X and Y sizes of the rectangle in dots with the (p4, p5) parameters.
Specify the amount of movement in the X and Y directions to be moved with the (p6, p7) parameters in dots.
After executing the command, the number of collision detection results created is assigned to the system variable stat. Usually, at least one result is created.
If the p8 parameter is 1, the coordinate values of (p2, p3) and (p6, p7) are treated as 32-bit values of the standard sprite (coordinates including the lower 16 bits) instead of dot units.
If multiple characters are hit simultaneously, multiple results are created. In that case, specify the index value of the result and acquire it with the es_getbghit command.
If execution fails for any reason, a value of 0 is returned to the system variable stat.

Specifies the size when defining the character pattern of the sprite.
For simple size settings, use the es_size command. The es_sizeex command allows you to set a more detailed collision detection area.
The X and Y sizes of the character are specified by the (p1, p2) parameters.
There are no particular restrictions on the X and Y sizes of the character, but specifying a character pattern that extends beyond the off-screen buffer is invalid.
The settings of the es_size command remain valid for all subsequent character definitions.
^
p3 is the default setting for special effects (EP value). Normally, it can be omitted.
The special effect (EP value) parameter specifies settings such as semi-transparency and additive composition. For details, refer to the standard sprite programming guide.
^
The p4 to p8 parameters are settings related to the hit check area for collision detection (collision detection is used not only for detecting collisions between sprites, but also for the area that collides with map cells).
The area of collision detection is the size specified by (p4, p5) from the location offset (moved) by the coordinates (p6, p7) from the coordinates where the sprite is displayed.
The (p8, p9) parameters specify the offset (movement) value when actually displaying on the screen. By specifying this value, it is possible to shift only the display position while leaving the collision detection area unchanged.

p1(0)=Drawing Offset Scaling Setting

%inst
Sets options for sprite drawing.
The p1 parameter sets the offset scaling during sprite drawing.
In standard sprites, when registering a character with the es_sizeex command, you can register a parameter called "Display Offset X,Y" to change the base point of the sprite's display coordinates.
For example, when registering a character with a size of 128 x 128 dots, the character is normally displayed with the specified coordinates as the upper left, but by setting the display offset as (-64, -64), the X and Y are shifted by 64 in the negative direction. That is, the center position of the character can be used as the base point for display.
By using this feature, you can change the center position of rotation and scaling (enlargement/reduction).
The offset scaling setting during drawing determines whether or not the size of this display offset itself is changed by scaling.
^
If the p1 parameter is 0, the display offset is scaled according to the sprite's magnification (set by the es_setrot command, etc.). This is the default setting.
If the p1 parameter is 1, the sprite's magnification does not affect the display offset. Drawing is always performed with a fixed display offset.
This setting can be used selectively at any time.
^
The drawing clipping setting determines whether or not the clipping process performed internally during sprite drawing is performed.
If the p2 parameter is 0, the drawing process is canceled when coordinates outside the screen are specified during sprite drawing. This avoids unnecessary drawing costs. This is the default setting.
If the p2 parameter is 1, the drawing process is performed even if coordinates outside the screen are specified. This makes it possible to execute the drawing process even when a different position than the coordinates originally drawn by the viewcalc command, etc. is specified.
Normally, the drawing clipping setting is fine in its default state, but it is provided for setting in special situations.
^
When initialized with the es_ini command, both the scaling setting and the clipping setting at drawing are initialized and set to 0.

Sets the life value and power value that the sprite has.
The life value can hold an integer value that increases or decreases, such as hit points or energy, which the sprite has uniquely.
The power value can hold an integer value that is the amount of attack that the sprite has uniquely.
The life value and power value do not change the behavior of the sprite itself. They are merely held as unique information and users are free to decide their use.
All sprites have Life Value/Max Life Value = 100, and Power Value = 1 as initial values.
The es_setlife command provides a mechanism for handling the life value as hit points and the power value as attack power.
It provides assistance for arbitrarily increasing or decreasing the life value and performing processing according to the result.
You can specify setting options with the p3 parameter.

  4   Subtract (minus) the setting value (p2) from the life value of the target sprite
  5   Subtract (minus) the power value of the sprite specified by p2 from the life value of the target sprite
^p
After executing this command, the final life value of the target sprite is assigned to the system variable stat.
For example, if the No. 0 sprite has a life value of 100, executing "es_setlife 0, 20, 4" will set the life value to 100-20 = 80, and 80 will be assigned to the system variable stat.
The life value will never be less than 0. Also, the upper limit is aligned with the maximum life value.
Even if the life value becomes 0, the sprite itself will not disappear. It only holds information.
