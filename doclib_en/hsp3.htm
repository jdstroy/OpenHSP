		<h2 id="ABOUT_HSP">What is HSP?</h2>
		<p>
			<abbr title="Hot Soup Processor">HSP</abbr> is a scripting language system that anyone can easily use.
			You can easily build image-based game programs, screen savers, tools, and practical software applications simply by writing scripts.
		</p>
		<p>
			HSP has the following features:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You can start using it immediately with a free development environment.</li>
			<li>Beginners can handle it with an easy-to-learn instruction set.</li>
			<li>Programs you create can be converted into executable files and freely redistributed, with no license fees required.</li>
			<li>Numerous functions such as 3D display and communication can be added via extension plugins and modules.</li>
			<li>It has a large user base and a track record of over 30 years.</li>
			<li>Equipped with detailed manuals and a reference help system.</li>
			<li>As a purely domestic tool, there are also abundant book resources.</li>
			<li>Software created with HSP3Dish conversion function can be run on android, iOS, Linux, WEB browsers (html5).</li>
			<li>Libraries for hardware control such as USB-IO and Arduino are included.</li>
			<li>The interpreter operation specification is published as open source.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			HSP can be used in various situations depending on your ideas.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>From visual novels to full-scale 3D shooting games, you can create games in various genres.</li>
			<li>Create desktop accessories and screen savers.</li>
			<li>For impromptu tools such as screen layout prototypes and image data conversion.</li>
			<li>For media browsers such as program launchers, menus, CG collections, and music collections.</li>
			<li>In addition, full-scale applications can also be developed.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="DOUSA_ENV">Operating Environment</h2>
		<p>
			HSP3 can operate the development environment on <b>Microsoft Windows, Linux/RaspberryPi</b>.
			Refer to the manual for each platform for detailed installation and usage instructions.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><a href="hsp3win.html">HSP3 Windows Version Manual</a></dt>
			<dt><a href="hsp3linux_pi.html">HSP3 Linux/RaspberryPi Version Manual</a></dt>
		</dl>
		<p>
			Refer to the <a href="hspprog.htm">Programming Manual</a> for HSP3 syntax and programming rules.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Windows version is the only development environment that supports the full functionality of HSP3. The Linux/RaspberryPi version only supports the command line version and HSP3Dish.<br>
			Source code created in these development environments can be run on <b>android, iOS, html5 (WebGL)</b>. (There are some restrictions for each platform)
			Refer to the <a href="hsp3dish_prog.htm">HSP3Dish Programming Manual</a> for details on multi-platform development.

		<h2 id="ROADMAP">Future Plans</h2>
		<p>
			HSP3 development will continue in the future, aiming for an environment where ideas can be easily put into shape in a short amount of time.<br>
			We would like to incorporate what we can implement from the many requests and bug reports we have received.
			Future plans and future considerations are as follows.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>HSP3.7</dt>
			<dd>
			<p>
			We will continue to update the update version for functions that could not be implemented in HSP3.6.
			The functions that are being considered for future implementation are as follows. (This does not mean that they will be performed in this order.)
			</p>
			<dl>
			<li>Renewal of packfile, review of encryption function
			<li>Correction of HSP script editor and expansion of input/debug support
			<li>Organization and expansion of module functions
			<li>32-bit support and speed-up of HSP drawing buffer
			<li>Sharing of code and materials using network connection, support for community
			</dl>
			</dd>
			<dt>HSP4</dt>
			<dd>
			<p>
			HSP2 appeared in 1997, and HSP3 appeared 8 years later, but we hope to connect it to the next generation along with changes in the times.
			The situation required for programming is also changing. While inheriting the ease of HSP, we would like to cut compatibility to some extent and create something that is easy to use, and announce it as a roadmap in the future.<br>
			Currently under consideration are complete UTF-8, 64-bit support, automatic code analysis and learning functions, VM renewal (llvm, etc.), and native compilation (JIT).

		<h2 id="EDUCATION">About Use for Educational Purposes</h2>
		<p>
			onion software continues to promote the use of HSP for basic IT education while conducting activities to spread its use.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please feel free to use it in elementary school, junior high school, and high school classes, club activities, etc.
			The HSP itself can of course be used free of charge, and the attached manuals, documents,
			and the text of help data can also be freely quoted, modified, and redistributed.
			In addition, many reference books are sold in Japan, and a great deal of information is available even when studying on your own.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lectures have already been given in some computer classrooms, and education using HSP has also been implemented in the "IT Craftsmanship Project" supported by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			We believe that HSP has many advantages for beginners.
			We believe that it is necessary to create an environment where beginners can learn with fun above all else, and we emphasize elements that allow them to continue learning without losing interest, such as pictures that move, sounds that are produced,
            and reactions that occur.

		<h2 id="MESSAGE">Message from the Author</h2>
		<p>
			HSP is not particularly compatible with other languages (although it is mostly BASIC),
			nor does it have a new language system.
		</p>
		<p>
			What HSP aimed for is an old-style computer system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Old computers were far less powerful in terms of memory and CPU speed than modern computers,
			but you could turn them on and use them right away, and if you typed RUN in BASIC, you could see the results right away.
			I feel that such an easy and casual system is being lost in modern computers.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are no advanced language specifications such as object-oriented programming here,
			but there is the ease of writing in the order you think of.
			And I think that's another way to go for small-scale development and programming learning for beginners.
		</p>
		<p>
			HSP is by no means a versatile system. If you want to do more advanced things or large-scale development with an interpreter,
			languages such as C#, Python, and Java would be more suitable.
			I hope that HSP can be nimble for small processes that don't require such advanced languages.
		</p>
