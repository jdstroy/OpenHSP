		<h2 id="BRIEF">Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		The "Tamane Dot Framework" is a set of dot-picture HSP3 official materials and libraries that can be used on HSP3Dish.<br>
		With a simple instruction set specialized for games and an all-in-one material package, you can easily start creating retro-style original games.
		The created games can be released not only on Windows but also on the Web, Raspberry Pi, Linux, Android, iOS, etc.<br>
		Tamane is the official mascot character of HSP3. 2D materials and 3D materials have been provided before. In addition, there are sample games that can be easily played in a web browser, so be sure to check them out.<br>
		<br><img src="image/s_fwtest.jpg"><br><br>
		The scripts included in the archive can be used with Hot Soup Processor (HSP3). Image and sound materials can be freely incorporated into your own software.

		<h2 id="DATA">Material Data Details</h2>
		<p>
		Contains 2D materials based on the HSP official character "Tamane".
		The "tamane16.png" file is the actual image data.<br>
		Files in bmp format and png format are available. Normally, use the png format, which includes an alpha channel value that is transparent in HSP3Dish.<br><br>

		<br><img src="image/tamane16.png" width="512" height="512"><br><br>
		The image size is 128 x 128 dots, with 16 x 16 dot materials arranged in 8 patterns horizontally and 8 patterns vertically.
		The material includes picture materials that can be used in games, such as Tamane-chan, monsters, items, and explosion marks, and can be used in various situations depending on the idea.<br>
		The "tamane16.png" file can be freely used not only in HSP3 but also in other programming environments.
		</p>


		<h2 id="INSTALL">How to Use Modules</h2>
		<p>
		The "Tamane Dot Framework" is a module that can be used from HSP3.6 onwards.
		Based on HSP3Dish and standard sprites, it summarizes general-purpose processing, effects, joystick support, etc. used in games.<br>
		Copy the following files included in the archive to the common folder below the HSP3 installation folder, or place them in the same folder as the script to be executed.
		</p>
		<pre>
		dotfw.as	Dot framework body
		mod_res.as	Image resource manager
		</pre>
		<p>
		A command help file is included. By copying the following file to the hsphelp folder below the HSP3 installation folder, you can display help by pressing the [F1] key.
		</p>
		<pre>
		dotfw.hs	Help file
		</pre>


		<h2 id="SAMPLE">Basic Script</h2>
		<p>
		When using the Tamane Dot Framework, simply add
		</p>
		<pre>
		#include "dotfw.as"
		</pre>
		<p>
		to the first line.<br>
		For example, by adding the following 6 lines, all processes such as basic screen initialization, player display, key and joystick operation, and bullet firing are performed.
		</p>
		<pre>
			#include "dotfw.as"
			df_config "fc Z300 star"
			df_reset
			df_addplayer
		*main
			df_update
			goto *main
		</pre>
		<p>
		Of course, depending on the user's description, you can add unique processing such as special movements and actions. You can also use all commands related to HSP3Dish and standard sprites.<br>
		You can perform a test display by executing the script of the included sample "fwtest??.hsp" on the HSP script editor.<br>Please use it as a reference when using it.<br>
		<br><img src="image/s_dfwtest3.jpg" width="320"><br><br>

		</p>


		<h2 id="CONFIG">Screen Initialization</h2>
		<p>
		When using the Tamane Dot Framework, you must first perform the settings using the df_config command and the initialization using the df_reset command.<br>
		With the df_config command, you can configure the dot framework using tag strings.
		By specifying tag strings separated by spaces, you can perform all the necessary settings collectively.
		</p>
		<pre>
		df_config "X320 Y240 Z300 star"
		df_reset
		</pre>
		<p>
		In the above example, the setting is to display the screen at (320 x 240) and zoomed in 300% (3x in both vertical and horizontal directions).
		By adding the "star" tag, you can have stars flow in the background.
		The order in which tag strings are written does not matter.
		</p>
		<pre>
		df_config "fc Z300"
		df_reset
		</pre>
		<p>
		In the above example, the tag "fc" indicating the Family Computer is used.
		In this case, it is initialized as (256 x 224) and zoomed in 300% (3x in both vertical and horizontal directions, slightly horizontally long dots).<br>
		In this way, you can specify the specifications of typical retro game consoles and personal computers as presets using tags. (It only reproduces typical resolutions and does not reproduce display methods or the number of colors).<br>
		You can specify the following keywords for presets.
		</p>
		<pre>
		Tag String    Content
		---------------------------------------------------------------
		  X???        ??? = Set the screen width
		  Y???        ??? = Set the screen height

		<h2 id="OBJECTS">Display Elements</h2>
		<p>
		The display components of the Tamane Dot Framework are mainly four.
		</p>
		<pre>
		・Background (BG)
		・Player character and missile
		・Enemy character and missile
		・Effect
		・Text display screen
		</pre>
		<p>
		In the current version, basic parts and processing that allow you to create shooting games are built-in.
		In future versions, processing for players and enemies will be added to suit various styles of games.
		</p>


		<h2 id="BG">Background (BG)</h2>
		<p>
		You can display images and map data (.tmap) as the background.
		</p>
		<pre>
			df_celload id_bgpic,"yamabg16.png"
			df_setbgpic 0,id_bgpic
			df_bgscroll 0, DIR_LEFT, 50
		</pre>
		<p>
		In the above example, the image file "yamabg16.png" is displayed as the background and set to scroll slowly.
		Multiple elements can be displayed in the background.
		In that case, it is identified by the BG number starting from 0.
		<br><img src="image/s_fwtest4.jpg" width="480"><br><br>
		</p>
		<pre>
			df_loadbgmap 0, "test.tmap"
			df_bgpoint 0, 20,40
		</pre>
		<p>
		In the above example, the map file "test.tmap" is displayed as the background.
		The df_bgpoint command specifies the display position of the displayed background. In the above example, it will be displayed from the position (20, 40).
		<br><img src="hsp3dish/tamamap.jpg" width="640"><br><br>
		The .tmap file can be edited with the map editor included with HSP3. For details, please refer to the <a href="tamamap.html" target="_blank">"Map Editor Tamamap Manual"</a>.
		</p>


		<h2 id="CHARACTERS">Basic Characters</h2>
		<p>
		The basic characters of the Tamane Dot Framework can be defined and specified using the macro "CHR_*".
		These are included in the "tamane16.png" file, and you can easily make them appear as characters, including animations.
		</p>

		<p>
		In the current version, basic parts and processing that allow you to create shooting games are built-in.
		In future versions, processing for players and enemies will be added to suit various styles of games.
		</p>


		<h2 id="PLAYER">Player</h2>
		<p>
		The player can be added with the df_addplayer command.
		</p>
		<pre>
		df_addplayer p1,p2,p3,p4

		p1(0) : X coordinate
		p2(0) : Y coordinate
		p3(0) : Character No.
		p4(0) : option value
		</pre>
		<p>
		Specify the initial coordinates of the player with (p1, p2). If omitted, it will be in the center of the screen.<br>
		The p3 parameter is the character No. to be used by the standard sprite (defined by a macro starting with "CHR_").
		For the character, you can also specify a character No. that you have defined yourself using the standard sprite's es_pat and es_patanim commands.<br>
		If the character No. is omitted, Tamane (CHR_TAMANE) will be used.<br>
		When you add a player character, the user can control it with the controller. Furthermore, it is set up so that missiles are fired when the action button is pressed.<br>
		The player's movement settings can be performed with the df_pmode command.
		</p>
		<pre>
		df_pmode p1,p2,p3

		p1(0) : Action mode
		p2(0) : X coordinate movement speed
		p3(0) : Y coordinate movement speed
		</pre>
		<p>
		You can also limit the movement range with the df_parea command.<br>
		If you want to add detailed movements, you can add a control subroutine and write your own processing.
		</p>
		<pre>
		df_paction *label,p1

		*label : Control subroutine label
		p1(0)  : Player action type
		</pre>
		<p>
		Specify the player action type with the p1 parameter. You can select the type from the following macros.
		</p>
		<pre>
		Macro Name              Type
		----------------------------------------------
		PACTION_CONTROL       Movement every frame
		PACTION_KEY           During control (operation) (*)
		PACTION_BUTTON        When button 1 is pressed (*)
		PACTION_BUTTON2       When button 2 is pressed
		PACTION_BUTTON3       When button 3 is pressed
		PACTION_MISS          When missing (when defeated) (*)
		PACTION_ITEM          When item is acquired
		PACTION_MAPITEM       When map item is acquired
		PACTION_MAPNOTICE     When map setting information is acquired

		(*) indicates types with standard movements set by default
		</pre>
		<p>
		Control subroutines are used to replace standard player actions.
		The specified control subroutine is called when the situation indicated by the player action type occurs.<br>
		In the control subroutine, you can proceed with the sprite and game progress processing according to the situation.<br>
		For example, when you add a player, there are free movements set, but you can replace the control subroutine by specifying the PACTION_KEY type and change it to your own movement program.
		The mechanism that fires missiles when you press a button is done by a program that operates with the PACTION_BUTTON type.<br>
		By adding a control subroutine of type PACTION_BUTTON2, you can add actions such as firing a different missile when button 2 is pressed.
		By adding and changing control subroutines, you can add your own actions to the player.
		</p>


		<h2 id="ENEMY">Enemy</h2>
		<p>
		The enemy can be added with the df_addenemy command.
		</p>
		<pre>
		df_addenemy p1,p2,p3,p4

		p1(0) : X coordinate
		p2(0) : Y coordinate
		p3(0) : Character No.
		p4(0) : Direction of movement (DIR_*)
		</pre>
		<p>
		Adds an enemy at the (p1, p2) coordinates. The enemy is set as a character that attacks the player.<br>
		The p3 parameter specifies the direction to move first. This is a value from 0 to 255 to specify the direction. You can also specify the following macros.
		</p>
		<pre>
		Macro Name   Value       Direction
		---------------------------
		DIR_UP     128      Up
		DIR_DOWN   0        Down
		DIR_LEFT   192      Left
		DIR_RIGHT  64       Right
		</pre>
		<p>
		The p4 parameter specifies the movement speed. If you specify 100, it will move at a speed of 1 dot per frame.
		If the p4 parameter is omitted, the value set by the df_emode command will be applied.<br>
		The generated enemy has the following information.
		</p>
		<pre>
		Information                Content
		-------------------------------------------------
	        X, Y coordinates             Display position
	        Direction of movement            Direction to move first
	        Movement speed (%)     Movement speed
	        Character No.       Displayed character (*)
		Action mode (0〜)     Value that determines the movement (*)
		Firing rate (%)       Probability of firing a bullet (*)
		Interval        Number of frames until the next action (*)
	        exprm value             Value passed to the mode control (*)
	        option value            Sprite option value (*)

		(*) The items with (*) attached use the ones set by the df_emode command.
		</pre>
		<p>
		Another way to add an enemy is to use the df_enemygen command.
		This has the function of randomly generating enemies in a specified range.
		The df_enemygen command generates enemies at a specified probability at regular intervals. For the generated enemy, only the coordinates and direction of movement are set, and the parameters set by the df_emode command are used for the rest.
The p1 parameter specifies the direction in which the enemy to be generated will move first.
		</p>
		<pre>
		df_enemygen p1,p2,p3

		p1(0) : Direction of movement
		p2(0) : Generation rate (%)
		p3(0) : Interval
		</pre>
		<p>
		The most important factor in determining the enemy's movement is the action mode. There are presets created in advance by the dot framework and ones that the user can freely create.
		The preset action modes have macros defined starting with "EMODE_".<br>
		To create an action mode, use the df_emodesub command.
		</p>
		<pre>
		df_emodesub p1,*label

		p1(0)  : Action mode (0〜)
		*label : Control subroutine label
		</pre>
		<p>
		The df_emodesub command sets the control subroutine to be processed for each action mode of the enemy.
		Specify the action mode with the p1 parameter.<br>
		When the enemy's action mode is set, the specified control subroutine is called every turn.
		In the control subroutine, you can proceed with the enemy's movement processing according to the situation.
		The following variables are automatically set when the control subroutine is called.
		</p>
		<pre>
		Variable Name                Content
		----------------------------------------------
		_dotfw_cursp          Current sprite ID
		_dotfw_curemode       Current action mode
		_dotfw_enemy_exprm    exprm value
		</pre>
		<p>
		Other information can be acquired as appropriate variables with the df_getaxis, df_getenemyprm commands, etc.
		</p>


		<h2 id="SEQUENCE">Enemy Sequence Control</h2>
		<p>
		Sequence control is a mechanism for switching modes for each time (frame) in the enemy's action.
		It can be used when switching multiple modes for each time, rather than a single action mode.<br>
		You can register data for sequence control with the df_addseq command.
		To enable sequence control, use "EMODE_SEQ" and the sequence ID for the action mode specified by the df_emode command.
		For example, if you specify "EMODE_SEQ+10" for the action mode, sequence control with sequence ID 10 will be performed.
		</p>
		<pre>
		df_addseq p1,p2,p3,p4

		p1(0) : Sequence ID (0 = new)
		p2(0) : Action mode (0〜)
		p3(0) : Timer value
		p4(0) : exprm value
		</pre>
		<p>
		For details, please refer to the help for each command.
		</p>


		<h2 id="BGMAP">Cooperation with BG Map</h2>
		<p>
		<img src="hsp3dish/fwmap2.jpg" width="480"><br><br>
		By cooperating with the BG map, you can scroll a wide background and apply it to making games that use the background as a foothold.
		</p>
		<pre>
		df_mapaction            Map action setting
		df_bgview               Player scroll setting
		df_loadbgmap            BG map loading
		</pre>
		<p>
		You can set cooperation with the BG map with these commands.
		</p>
		<pre>
			df_mapaction p1,p2,p3			Map action setting
				p1(0) : BG number (0〜)
				p2(0) : Gravity setting
				p3(0) : Jumping power setting
		</pre>
		<p>
		This command sets the action mode of the dot framework to the map action.
		After that, the collision detection is performed based on the attribute information set in the BG map, and the action is linked with the map.<br>
		Specify the BG number with the p1 parameter. The map must be set in advance for the BG with the df_loadbgmap command.<br>
		Specify the value of the gravity setting with the p2 parameter. By setting the downward gravity, the jumping action will be performed.<br>
		The value of the gravity setting is the acceleration added every frame, and 65536 is equivalent to 1 dot.<br>
		If you specify the gravity setting to 0, gravity will not occur. Also, there will be no actions such as jumping, and you will be able to move freely in 4 directions.<br>
		Set the player's jumping power with the p3 parameter. The unit is the same as the gravity setting.<br>
		After the map action is set, the player will be displayed in conjunction with the scrolling map.<br>
		If you want to scroll so that the player enters the screen properly, specify the df_bgview command.
		</p>
		<pre>
			df_bgview p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7		Specify the link between the background map and the player
				p1(0) : BG number (0〜)
				p2(0) : X direction scroll start position rate (%)
				p3(0) : Y direction scroll start position rate (%)
				p4(0) : X direction scroll tracking rate (%)
				p5(0) : Y direction scroll tracking rate (%)
				p6(0) : X direction scroll start position adjustment
				p7(0) : Y direction scroll start position adjustment
		</pre>
		<p>
		This command specifies the link settings of the player displayed on the map.
		After that, even if the player moves, the map will scroll to the appropriate position and be adjusted to be displayed in the center of the screen.<br>
		Specify the BG number starting from 0 with the p1 parameter. The BG number is used when identifying multiple backgrounds.<br>
		Specify the rate (%) of the position to start scrolling with respect to the size of the entire screen with the (p2, p3) parameters. If omitted, it will be 50%.<br>
		Specify the rate (%) that the scroll follows with the (p4, p5) parameters. If you specify a value greater than 0, it will slowly follow even if it goes out of the scroll start range.<br>
		Fine-tune the scroll start position with the (p6, p7) parameters. You can adjust the position where the player is the center for each X and Y direction.<br>
		To fix the background scroll to a specific coordinate, you can use the df_bgviewfix command.
		</p>
		<pre>
			df_bgviewfix p1,p2,p3			Fix the display position of the background map
				p1(0) : BG number (0〜)
				p2(0) : X direction scroll position
				p3(0) : Y direction scroll position
		</pre>
		<p>
		By enabling gravity in cooperation with the BG map, you can easily create a jump action game.
		In that case, the jump button (the [Z] key in the case of a keyboard) will be automatically assigned.<br><br>
		<img src="hsp3dish/fwmap4.jpg" width="480"><br><br>
		When cooperating with a BG map, you can set event information in the cells of the map and acquire it in the game.
		While cooperating with the BG map, you can acquire the following information with the df_getplayer command.
		</p>
		<pre>
			Variable Name                 Content
			----------------------------------------------
			_dotfw_cursp           Player sprite No.
			_dotfw_myx             X coordinate
			_dotfw_myy             Y coordinate
			_dotfw_myani           Animation counter

		<h2 id="TEXT">Text Display Screen</h2>
		<p>
		In the Tamane Dot Framework, there is a layer for displaying text on the very front of the screen, which allows for displaying text with a dedicated font.
		Here, you can use pre-prepared 8x8 dot English fonts. You can choose from 3 types, which can be selected with the df_config command.<br>
		It displays 256 types of characters, including English letters and symbols, in 16 colors.
		It also supports text screen shift (scrolling) and character reading.
		<br><img src="image/s_fwtest5.jpg" width="480"><br><br>
		</p>


		<h2 id="TEXT">Virtual Pad</h2>
		<p>
		By adding "vpad" to the initialization string, you can display a virtual pad.
		</p>
		<pre>
			#include "dotfw.as"
			df_config "pce Z300 vpad"
			df_reset
			df_addplayer
		*main
			df_update
			goto *main
		</pre>
		<p>
		The virtual pad is a display on the screen of four directions and four buttons used in games, etc., that can be used by touch, etc.
		The virtual pad is displayed in standard dots regardless of the screen zoom (magnification).
		You can adjust the initial position of the virtual pad by specifying an option value such as "V4" in the initialization string.
		</p>
		<pre>
		   Value  : Action
		 -----------------------------------------------------
		   1   : Swap the positions of the movement and action buttons
		   2   : Place the virtual pad display at the top of the screen
		   4   : Only display movement on the virtual pad
		</pre>
		<p>
		You can select multiple options by adding these values.
