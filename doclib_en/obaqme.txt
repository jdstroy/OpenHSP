・Introduction

	OBAQ Model Editor is a tool for easily creating 2D shapes that can be used with the
	HSP plugin obaq.dll and outputting them as data files.

	It is an editor for creating polygonal shapes while checking them on the screen.
	The created data can be saved and loaded in a dedicated format called ".qvd".
	A module for loading the created data from HSP3 scripts is also included.
	It only has basic functions.
	The source script is included, so anyone can modify, add to, and
	distribute it.


・How to Launch

	Load obaqme.hsp, located in the sample/obaq folder, with a script editor and
	execute it.
	If necessary, you can create an executable file (obaqme.exe) by pressing the
	[F9] key (automatic executable file creation) and execute it.


・Update History

	2010/1/28 ver0.1

		Initial version.


・Basic Operation

	What is created on the editing screen becomes the target of loading and saving as a single model.
	Create shapes by setting vertices with left-clicks on the editing screen.
	The red dot in the center is the center of gravity.

	※Be sure to place vertices in a "counter-clockwise" direction.

	When creating a shape, be sure to go around once and return to the same location as the first vertex.
	A polygon (closed shape) is recognized at the point when you return to the first vertex.

	A single model can combine multiple polygons.

	The only types of polygons that OBAQ can handle are convex.
	Do not try to create complex shapes with a single polygon, but combine multiple
	polygons.


・Vertex Editing

	Pressing the [ctrl] key enters vertex editing mode.
	If you press the [ctrl] key on an existing vertex, that vertex becomes the target of editing.
	If you press the [ctrl] key in an empty space, the previously edited
	vertex becomes the target of editing.
	(The vertex to be edited can be changed with the left and right cursor keys.)

	By clicking a new location with the left button while holding down [ctrl], you can
	change the coordinates of the vertex being edited.
	Also, you can delete a vertex by clicking the right button while holding down [ctrl].
	However, for safety, vertex deletion is only performed when the cursor is
	pointing at the target vertex.

・Preview

	By pressing the "TEST" button, you can view the currently edited model
	in a separate window to check it.


・Load, Save

	By pressing the "SAVE" and "LOAD" buttons, you can save and load the data
	you are currently editing to a file.
	The saved file will have the ".qvd" extension.


・Convert

	By pressing the "CONVERT" button, you can create a binary file in a form that can be used from a script.
	The file created here has the extension ".qvb".
	Unlike the format used for loading and saving in the tool, unnecessary
	data for editing is removed.


・Loading Module

	By using "mod_qvb.as", you can load .qvb files into a script.
	A sample (qvbtest.hsp) is also included, so please refer to it.
