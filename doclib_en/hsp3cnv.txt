**・Introduction**

The HSP3 Source Converter is a tool and library designed to convert HSP3 code into other source formats.
The HSP3 Source Converter aims to convert HSP source scripts to be operational on other systems as much as possible,
but it does not guarantee the conversion of all HSP source scripts.

**・How to Use**

The HSP3 Source Converter can be used via HSP3Dish helper (hsp3dh) or by directly calling hsp3cnv.exe from the command line (prompt).
To perform the conversion using a GUI, select "Convert Specified File to C Source" from the "Tools" menu of the HSP script editor to launch the HSP3Dish helper.
Then, specify the source script and press the "Convert" button to generate a C language source with the ".cpp" extension.
By checking the "Convert Output Source to UTF-8" option, you can generate a source with UTF-8 character encoding.
This is necessary when transferring the source to platforms other than Windows.
UTF-8 conversion is not required when compiling on Windows.

**・About hsp3cnv.exe**

This is a command-line application that converts HSP3 object files (ax) to C source.

Execute it from the command line (prompt) as follows:

    hsp3cnv filename

For example, to convert test.ax, specify:

    hsp3cnv test

If successful, it will output a test.cpp file based on the test.ax file.
* Even without using the command line, you can create a cpp file in the same folder by dragging and dropping the ax file (object file) icon onto hsp3cnv.

The outputted file can be compiled on a test project (hsp3rtest).

Specifying:

    hsp3cnv -d filename

will enable HSP3Dish source conversion mode.
HSP3Dish source conversion mode checks for external plugin commands and other platform incompatibilities.

**・About the Test Project**

A library is provided for linking with the source output by hsp3cnv.

Unzip:

hspsdk\hsp3cnv\hsp3rtest.zip

to generate the hsp3rtest project and the hsp3 project provided by OpenHSP.
Open hsp3rtest.vcproj in VC++ and build it to create an executable file that runs on Windows.
This project file is for VC++ 2005 but can be used similarly with 2008 or Express.
The source output by hsp3cnv is registered in the project as test.cpp.
If you want to use the cpp source generated by the user, rename it to test.cpp or re-register the file in the project.

**・Performance**

Currently, the speed is about 2 to 5 times faster than the interpreter (normal) version of HSP3.
(Note that it will be significantly slower if you leave it in Debug build mode.)
Further speed improvements can be achieved by using VC++'s PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization).

Also, OpenHSP has a version with a JIT compiler using llvm by zakki. This performs execution at the same speed as direct compilation from ax files.

**・Supported Features**

This version is a preview version, and its operation is limited to the following:

    ・Basic commands, basic functions, and system variables supported by HSP3
    ・int, double, str, and label type variables
    ・Module functions other than module variables (#module, #global)
    ・User-defined commands and functions (#deffunc, #defcfunc)
    ・DLL and plugin calls (tentative support)

The following features are not yet supported:

    ・Variable type extension and command type extension by plugins
    ・COM object manipulation, COM type/Variant type variables
    ・Module variables
    ・dll function pointer acquisition function by varptr function

The following features are not planned to be supported on this system:

    ・run command

**・Future Plans**

The HSP3 Source Converter is a system for converting HSP3 source code to other platforms and other language sources.
First, we are aiming to convert to C source code, but we are also considering other environments such as ActionScript, and we are preparing a library that can be used generically.
